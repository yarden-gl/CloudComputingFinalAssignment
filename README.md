# CloudComputingFinalAssignment

This course and assignment were based around AWS. For this assignment we were required to create a system that incorporated an AWS MicroService (e.g. EC2, EKS, Lambda, etc), and AWS Service we haven't covered in the course (we chose Kinesis) and Data Tiers (e.g. DBs, Lakes, Cachees, etc).

We chose to create a Voting System using stream processing, see the system architecture below.
